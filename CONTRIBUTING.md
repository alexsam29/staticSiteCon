## Before Submitting a Pull Request

1. Run Prettier via command `npx prettier --write .` to format your code while at the root folder.
2. Run ESlint via command `npx eslint .` to check for errors in your code while at the root folder, and then fix them, if any.
   It's fine to fix codes introduced by Prettier if needed.
